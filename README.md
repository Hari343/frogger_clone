Frogger clone
===============================

How to run:
Double-click index.html to launch the game. Or click this link: https://hari343.github.io/classic_arcade_game/. 
Chrome browser is recommended to play the game.

How to play:
Use arrow keys to move. You have to get your character to the waterfront without being bitten by the bugs. Each time you get your character there you'll receive a star. Note: if the bugs bite you you'll respawn at the initial postion and all the stars you have collected will vanish! Collect 5 stars to win the game.

I'll be continuosy adding more features to the game.
